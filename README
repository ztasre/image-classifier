The new batch are in png form, and they are in the following location

data/newRescored/pngsNeedConvert

The fully sorted and rescored data is here:

	data/newRescored
with the train and test sets in that dir. 

Everything has been fully renamed correctly as in everything in a pos directory is n1,
 and everything in a neg is n0.

* convert pngs add them to the full dataset, and then re-run the model. 
You should have now 9K images.


# June 15th 

Data is now fully converted over to jpgs in a dir location:
data/newRescored/pngsNeedConvert/raw-data


# June 15th 

renamed some directories, everything is basically lower case now.

* wrote a new image conversion script image2square which pads a image
up to a square based on largest dimension.
* ran the conversion on all the png
* split the converted images into pos and neg, and 
* the new directory to be trained from can be found in.

	data/new-rescored/train

* new images were only added to the training directory not test.

June 16th 

All images less than 200x200 have been removed, keep this in mind for future. 

June 24th

The script datasetup takes two parameters now.

usage:

./datasetup n1 .93, 

Means to seperate positive examples that have n1 and negative examples that 
don't. .93 means to use 93% of the data as training.


TODO:

script that checks for false positives and false negatives.
